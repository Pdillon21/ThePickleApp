&nbsp;
## Why?
> Hi,
> The idea of this project is to demonstrate my coding skills and overall knowledge on 
> Android Development. Collaboration for the project is closed (otherwise it would be 
> a demonstration of our skills, not mine), but feel free to clone the project and have
> fun with it. 
> If you wish to contact me to discuss any business/employment possibilites, you can 
> absolutely do so through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricio-dillon/).
> Best,
> P.D.
